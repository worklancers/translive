# Akool Video Translation AI Application

This project consists of a Video Translation AI application with a React frontend and Flask backend. The application allows users to translate videos to different languages along with lip sync.

## Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node Version Manager (nvm)
- Node.js v20
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup
1. Install Node.js v20 using nvm:
   ```bash
   nvm install 20
   nvm use 20
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd face_swap_frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Configuration
You'll need to update the webhook URLs in `src/App.tsx`. Search for URLs containing `ngrok-free.app` and replace them with your ngrok forwarding URL. For example:

Change:
```typescript
webhookUrl: "https://c184-219-91-134-123.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook"
```
to:
```typescript
webhookUrl: "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook"
```

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation & Setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd face_swap_webhook
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with your credentials:
   ```env
   CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

5. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:3007`

## Setting up ngrok

ngrok is required to create a public URL for your local webhook endpoint.

1. Install ngrok:
   - Download from ngrok website
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Follow the installation instructions for your OS

2. Authenticate ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken your_auth_token
   ```

3. Start ngrok to forward your backend port:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3007
   ```

Copy the forwarding URL (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app`) and update it in the frontend code as described in the Frontend Configuration section.

## Important Notes
- Make sure both frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously
- The ngrok URL changes every time you restart ngrok (unless you have a paid plan)
- Update the webhook URLs in the frontend whenever you get a new ngrok URL
- Keep your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` secure and never commit them to version control

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter CORS issues, ensure the backend CORS settings are properly configured
- If the websocket connection fails, check that your ports aren't blocked by a firewall
- For ngrok connection issues, ensure your authtoken is properly configured
